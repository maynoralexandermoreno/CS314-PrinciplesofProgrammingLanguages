Good practice for Haskell and Prolog:  
Haskell: https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems  
Prolog: http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2009s2/prolog/problemas/

Use of these resources were encouraged by Prof. Menendez, since they are good bases to use to complete his assignments and practice for the exams.
